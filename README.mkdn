Team Vanir's repo
===========

This branch is for Vanir's android-4.3_r2.1 based ROM


Getting Started
---------------

Please see the [Android source page](http://source.android.com/source/index.html) for building instructions.

To initialize your local repository using VanirAOSP's trees, use the following command:

    repo init -u git://github.com/VanirAOSP/platform_manifest.git -b jb43

If instead you want to directly track my working fork, use the following instead:

    repo init -u git://github.com/jmarcet/VanirAOSP_platform_manifest.git -b jb43

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j8
